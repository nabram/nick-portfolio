          I am a hybrid product, UX, and AI systems operator with experience spanning
          climate hardware, AI video platforms, and GTM. I like working on ambiguous
          problems where research, design, and execution need to come together quickly.

          This page will later be refined to match the final narrative we developed for my
          resume and case studies. For now it is a placeholder so the site architecture is
          complete.
