          <h2>Context</h2>
          <p>
            Niche Marketing worked with small businesses and organizations that needed
            more than a basic brochure site. Many clients were moving from static pages
            or outdated templates to digital experiences that actually needed to drive
            revenue, signups, or learning outcomes.
          </p>
          <p>
            My work lived at the intersection of UX, content, and business. I designed
            websites, storefronts, and educational experiences, then iterated based on
            how real users were behaving and what clients needed to achieve.
          </p>

        <section className="cs-section">
          <h2>My role</h2>
          <p>
            I operated as a hybrid product designer and UX generalist across multiple
            client projects. Concretely, I:
          </p>
          <ul className="cs-list">
            <li>
              Led UX and page structure for marketing sites, online shops, and course
              experiences.
            </li>
            <li>
              Designed wireframes and mid-fidelity layouts for desktop and mobile, then
              implemented them in no code and low code tools.
            </li>
            <li>
              Structured content, especially for long-form educational programs and
              course-based products.
            </li>
            <li>
              Collaborated with business owners on goals like lead generation, sales,
              and conversion, not just aesthetics.
            </li>
            <li>
              Maintained and updated sites over time based on performance and feedback.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section className="cs-section">
          <h2>Example: Small business entrepreneurship program</h2>
          <p>
            One of the most substantial projects was helping redesign coursework for an
            entrepreneurship program connected to Bank of America&apos;s small business
            efforts. The existing material was dense, fragmented, and hard for
            participants to navigate.
          </p>
          <p>
            My work included:
          </p>
          <ul className="cs-list">
            <li>
              Breaking down more than 300 pages of content and reorganizing it into a
              clearer, modular curriculum.
            </li>
            <li>
              Designing a structure where each module had a clear purpose, learning
              objective, and set of actionable takeaways.
            </li>
            <li>
              Creating a more intuitive way for participants to move between concepts,
              resources, and exercises.
            </li>
            <li>
              Aligning the content flow with how small business owners actually learn
              and apply new concepts in the real world.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This project reinforced my ability to handle large, messy content sets and
            turn them into coherent learning journeys.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section className="cs-section">
          <h2>Example: Storefronts and revenue lift</h2>
          <p>
            I also designed and maintained multiple online storefronts for clients. These
            projects focused on:
          </p>
          <ul className="cs-list">
            <li>Clarifying product offerings and value props.</li>
            <li>
              Reducing friction in browsing, cart, and checkout flows as much as the
              platform allowed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Improving information hierarchy on product pages and landing pages.
            </li>
            <li>
              Aligning visuals and copy with what customers actually cared about.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In several cases, these storefront redesigns contributed to meaningful
            revenue increases for clients, including situations where revenue
            approximately tripled after the new flows and presentation went live alongside
            other ongoing marketing efforts.

        <section className="cs-section">
          <h2>Approach</h2>
          <p>
            Across Niche Marketing projects, my approach was consistent even when the
            content and businesses varied:
          </p>
          <ul className="cs-list">
            <li>
              Start with business outcomes first: what counts as success for this site or
              experience?
            </li>
            <li>
              Map user journeys for the key actions: discovery, evaluation, purchase,
              signup, or completion.
            </li>
            <li>
              Design page structures, flows, and content modules that support those
              journeys.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implement in tools that allowed clients to maintain content without a heavy
              engineering lift.
            </li>
            <li>
              Iterate based on feedback from both clients and their customers.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section className="cs-section">
          <h2>Outcome</h2>
          <p>
            By the time I transitioned out of Niche Marketing, I had:
          </p>
          <ul className="cs-list">
            <li>
              Designed and supported dozens of sites and digital experiences for small
              businesses and programs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Helped clients improve revenue and conversion, including cases of roughly
              3× revenue lift after storefront redesigns.
            </li>
            <li>
              Delivered a 300+ page curriculum restructure that made a complex
              entrepreneurship program more navigable and actionable.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This work became the foundation for how I think about UX and business impact.
            It taught me to care about numbers and outcomes, not just visuals.

        <section className="cs-section">
          <h2>What this shows about my work</h2>
          <p>
            The Niche Marketing chapter shows that long before AI and complex product
            systems, I was:
          </p>
          <ul className="cs-list">
            <li>
              Designing for real businesses, where conversion and clarity actually
              mattered.
            </li>
            <li>
              Comfortable with large, messy content sets and long form educational
              material.
            </li>
            <li>
              Grounding UX decisions in outcomes, not just aesthetics.
            </li>
            <li>
              Building habits that later translated into how I run AI powered product and
              growth work today.
