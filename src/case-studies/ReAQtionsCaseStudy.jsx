          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            ReAQtions, originally called CanAIRy, was a community driven indoor air quality project
            created through a Stanford Design Fellowship in collaboration with Acterra, a climate
            focused nonprofit. Many families cooked with gas stoves and lived with poor ventilation
            but had no intuitive way to understand indoor air quality in their own homes.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a co founder I helped define the product, lead research with families and community
            leaders, contribute to hardware and interaction design, and work with Acterra on how the
            device could fit into broader electrification and community health efforts.

        <section className="cs-section">
          <h2>The problem</h2>
          <p>
            Indoor air pollution is invisible until symptoms appear. Families knew in abstract terms
            that gas stoves and poor ventilation could be harmful, but there was no simple way to see
            what was happening in their own kitchens or connect it to daily decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Existing tools focused on detailed metrics and dashboards. They provided data but not an
            easy, shared signal that could drive behavior change for people with different ages,
            languages, and levels of technical comfort.
          </p>
          <p>
            We framed the central question as:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>
              How can we give households a simple, shared indicator of indoor air quality that helps
              them build better habits and supports electrification decisions over time?
            </em>

          <h2>My role</h2>
          <p>As a co founder my responsibilities spanned multiple disciplines:</p>
          <ul className="cs-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Product and UX.</strong> Shaping the core concept, interaction model, and how
              air quality states were communicated in a glanceable way.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Research.</strong> Interviewing families and community leaders, running pilots,
              and synthesizing findings into design decisions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Hardware prototyping.</strong> Contributing to form factor and indicator
              exploration for the physical device.

            <li>
              <strong>Partnerships and GTM.</strong> Collaborating with Acterra and program

          <h2>Scope and pilots</h2>
          <p>
            Between 2021 and 2023 we focused on a small but deep set of pilots rather than broad
            distribution:
          </p>
          <ul className="cs-list">
            <li>Collaboration with Acterra and faculty in three academic contexts.</li>
            <li>Two main deployment waves, reaching roughly twenty families.</li>
            <li>
              An emphasis on kitchens and living spaces, where household routines and ventilation
              decisions actually happen.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The goal was to understand whether a simple, well designed signal could change behavior
            in real homes, not just in theory.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section className="cs-section">
          <h2>Approach</h2>
          <h3>Research and framing</h3>
          <p>
            We started with qualitative research. We spoke with families, community leaders, and
            Acterra staff about how they cooked, when they used fans or opened windows, and what
            they believed about indoor air quality.
          </p>
          <p>We found that:</p>
          <ul className="cs-list">
            <li>Health concerns were real, especially for families managing asthma.</li>
            <li>
              The link between specific actions and air quality was often vague. People did not know
              when air quality was actually good or bad.
            </li>
            <li>
              Most people were not interested in charts and units. They wanted to know simply if
              they should do something different right now.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Designing the device and interaction</h3>
          <p>
            With these insights we explored device concepts that could live naturally in a home
            environment. The core design principles were:
          </p>
          <ul className="cs-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Glanceable.</strong> The device needed clear states that could be understood
              from across the room without reading numbers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Shared language.</strong> Adults and children needed to interpret the signals
              the same way so that anyone could prompt an action.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Encouraging tone.</strong> The device was framed as a helper rather than an
              alarm, nudging people toward healthier behavior.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I contributed to early device prototypes and the definition of how the device communicated
            air quality states through light, color, and other cues.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section className="cs-section">
          <h2>Pilots and behavior change</h2>
          <p>
            We placed devices in selected homes and followed how families interacted with them over
            time. We observed when people reacted to changes, when they ignored signals, and how the
            device fit into their everyday routines.
          </p>
          <p>Families reported:</p>
          <ul className="cs-list">
            <li>Turning on kitchen fans more consistently while cooking.</li>
            <li>Opening windows more often during and after activities that degraded air.</li>
            <li>
              Paying closer attention to how long air quality took to return to a healthier state.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            One story stood out. A community leader with asthma shared that her indoor air quality
            had improved after using the device. Her grandchildren quickly learned how to read the
            indicator and would remind her to open windows and turn on fans whenever the device
            signaled poor air. The device became a shared reference point for healthier habits.

        <section className="cs-section">
          <h2>Outcome</h2>
          <p>
            ReAQtions validated that a simple, well designed signal could influence indoor air
            quality behaviors in real households. It provided:
          </p>
          <ul className="cs-list">
            <li>
              A working prototype that families could understand and act on without training or
              technical knowledge.
            </li>
            <li>
              Evidence that linking air quality to daily actions can build better ventilation habits.
            </li>
            <li>
              A concrete tool and set of learnings that Acterra could use in programs focused on
              climate, health, and electrification.
            </li>
            <li>
              A strong example of community engaged hardware plus UX work in the Stanford context.
