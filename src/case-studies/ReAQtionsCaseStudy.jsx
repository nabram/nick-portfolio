        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          ReAQtions (formerly CanAIRy) was a community health and indoor air-quality project launched through
          Stanford’s Design Impact Fellowship. From 2021 to 2023, our team designed, prototyped, and piloted
          a device and behavioral intervention system that helped families reduce indoor air pollution and
          encouraged safer home electrification.

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Families in underserved communities often face high exposure to indoor pollutants due to
          limited ventilation, aging gas appliances, and lack of awareness. Poor indoor air quality correlates
          with asthma, respiratory stress, and long-term health risks. Existing monitoring solutions were too
          expensive, too technical, or too detached from user behavior.

        <h2>What We Built</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A simple, glanceable indoor air quality device that communicates air status through a clear,
            family-friendly display.
          </li>
          <li>
            Behavioral prompts that encourage actions like opening windows, using fans, and adjusting cooking
            routines to reduce particulate exposure.
          </li>
          <li>
            A community-based deployment model in partnership with Acterra and local leaders.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Co-founder and product lead for research, prototyping, and deployment.</li>
          <li>Developed and iterated on hardware prototypes and user testing plans.</li>
          <li>Co-designed UX and behavioral nudging mechanisms.</li>
          <li>Led family interviews, environmental testing, and pilot strategy.</li>
          <li>Coordinated community partnerships and device distribution.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Pilots & Results</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Ran two pilots across ~20 families.</li>
          <li>
            Observed measurable improvements in air quality when families adopted ventilation behaviors
            recommended by the device.
          </li>
          <li>
            Children became active participants, reminding parents when the device signaled poor air quality.
          </li>
          <li>
            A community leader with asthma reported significant personal benefit and improved home conditions.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why This Project Matters</h2>
        <p>
          ReAQtions demonstrated how thoughtful design, culturally sensitive research, and community-led
          deployment can meaningfully improve public health outcomes. It also shaped my product philosophy —
          systems thinking, behavior-driven design, and real-world impact.
