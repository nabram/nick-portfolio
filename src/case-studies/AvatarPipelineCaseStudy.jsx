          <h2>Context</h2>
          <p>
            AI Studios already had a set of stock avatars, but the catalog was limited in
            diversity, scenarios, and production quality. Customers wanted more choice
            across roles, demographics, and use cases, and we knew that the avatar
            experience was central to how people perceived the product.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, demand was growing for <strong>instant avatars</strong> –
            personalized characters created from a short recording – which required a
            robust pipeline and clear UX to feel trustworthy.
          </p>

        <section className="cs-section">
          <h2>My role</h2>
          <p>
            I operated as a hybrid product, UX, and program lead across the avatar
            initiative. Concretely, I:
          </p>
          <ul className="cs-list">
            <li>
              Researched avatar needs across customer segments and competitive products.
            </li>
            <li>
              Designed the catalog structure and categories for the 150+ avatar set and
              instant avatars.
            </li>
            <li>
              Led internal focus groups to prioritize which avatars to create first.
            </li>
            <li>
              Coordinated with talent agencies, managed contracts, and helped plan shoots.
            </li>
            <li>
              Worked with the Korean team to organize U.S. filming sessions and logistics.
            </li>
            <li>
              Defined requirements for gestures and more lifelike motion and expression.
            </li>
            <li>
              Helped shape the UX for instant avatar creation and evaluated third party
              integration options.

          </ul>
        </section>

        <section className="cs-section">
          <h2>Approach</h2>

          <h3>1. Research and catalog design</h3>
          <p>
            I started with a landscape of who uses AI Studios and how avatars show up in
            their workflows. This included:
          </p>
          <ul className="cs-list">
            <li>Internal sales and CS feedback on what customers were asking for.</li>
            <li>
              Competitive analysis of other avatar based platforms and their catalogs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mapping use cases like news, education, training, corporate comms, and
              marketing.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            From this I designed a catalog model that covered roles, demographics,
            clothing, tone, and usage contexts, then worked backwards into a staged plan
            for which avatars we needed in v3.0 and which could follow.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Internal selection and prioritization</h3>
          <p>
            To align stakeholders, I ran focus sessions with internal teams to review
            candidate avatars and combinations. The goal was to:
          </p>
          <ul className="cs-list">
            <li>
              Validate that the catalog felt rich and globally relevant rather than narrow
              or repetitive.
            </li>
            <li>
              Identify must-have characters for enterprise demos and specific deals.
            </li>
            <li>
              Balance variety with production constraints and timeline.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3. Talent, shoots, and production pipeline</h3>
          <p>
            I coordinated closely with a talent agency and our Korean production team on:
          </p>
          <ul className="cs-list">
            <li>Talent casting and approvals.</li>
            <li>Contracts and payment logistics.</li>
            <li>
              Scheduling and logistics for bringing team members to U.S. shoots when
              needed.
            </li>
            <li>
              On set planning to capture multiple characters and gestures efficiently.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While I did not personally edit the final footage, I worked with creative and
            engineering teams to make sure what we captured would translate into high
            quality, consistent avatars within AI Studios.
          </p>

          <h3>4. Gestures, lifelike motion, and instant avatars</h3>
          <p>
            We knew that simply adding more faces was not enough; avatars had to feel more
            natural. I contributed to:
          </p>
          <ul className="cs-list">
            <li>
              Defining gesture sets and movements that would work across multiple use
              cases without feeling robotic.
            </li>
            <li>
              Evaluating how different capture setups affected realism and consistency.
            </li>
            <li>
              Shaping the basic flow for personal instant avatars so that users could
              create their own characters with clear expectations and boundaries.
            </li>
            <li>
              Exploring third party tools and integrations that could enhance instant
              avatar quality and speed.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section className="cs-section">
          <h2>Outcome</h2>
          <p>
            The initiative expanded AI Studios from roughly two dozen stock avatars to a
            library of <strong>150+ avatars</strong> across roles, demographics, and
            styles, alongside instant avatar capabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following the launch of the expanded catalog and instant avatars, AI Studios
            saw a <strong>roughly 7× increase in subscribers over a three month
            period</strong>. While this growth came from a combination of product and GTM
            work, the significantly richer avatar experience was a visible driver of
            adoption and upsell.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project also left behind a repeatable pipeline for future avatars and
            clarified how creative, engineering, and GTM should collaborate on character
            design.
          </p>

        <section className="cs-section">
          <h2>What this shows about my work</h2>
          <p>This project highlights how I operate when AI product work is deeply visual and operational:</p>
          <ul className="cs-list">
            <li>
              I can take an ambiguous request like “we need more avatars” and turn it into
              a structured catalog and pipeline.
            </li>
            <li>
              I move comfortably between research, UX, creative direction, and operations
              without losing the through line.
            </li>
            <li>
              I treat content and assets as part of product strategy, not just
              “marketing” or “production.”
            </li>
            <li>
              I help connect these investments to subscription growth and enterprise
              value, not just aesthetics.
