      <section>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          From June 2023 to March 2024, I led a critical UI/UX refresh for AI Studios at DeepBrain AI,
          focusing on reducing churn, improving editor usability, increasing completion rates, and enabling
          the broader v3.0 product direction. My analysis, presentation, and redesign recommendations directly
          informed the new UI and became ~70 percent of the final shipped interface.

      <section>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Users struggled with inefficient workflows, unclear navigation, hidden features, and inconsistent
          branding across the app. These issues contributed to elevated churn rates and reduced video export
          completions. The v2.0 UI limited growth, enterprise adoption, and user retention.

        <h2>What I Did</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Conducted a complete UX teardown and audit of every page, modal, and workflow.</li>
          <li>Recorded detailed usability walkthroughs to reveal friction points and hidden features.</li>
          <li>Interviewed customers and internal teams to uncover unmet needs and clarity gaps.</li>
          <li>Rebuilt the app’s core interaction model around “Entice → Enter → Engage → Exit → Extend.”</li>
          <li>Designed high-level flows, structure, and UI recommendations for a refreshed visual hierarchy.</li>
          <li>Presented directly to the CEO, whose approval triggered immediate integration into the roadmap.</li>
        </ul>
