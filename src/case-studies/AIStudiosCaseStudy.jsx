          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            AI Studios is DeepBrain AI&apos;s core AI video platform. Before this work, the product
            had grown feature by feature, which led to a fragmented editor experience, unclear
            navigation, and hidden value. Users were churning at a high rate and internal teams
            knew the product felt harder to demo than it needed to be.
          </p>
          <p>
            I led an end to end UX and workflow audit, mapped the product through the lens of
            churn and completion behavior, and proposed a new structure that became the basis for
            the AI Studios 3.0 interface.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section className="cs-section">
          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>
            The editor was powerful but disjointed. Creation flows were not obvious, features
            that should have been differentiators were buried, and the app lacked a clear sense
            of hierarchy. For new users this meant confusion. For existing users it meant extra
            steps and workarounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            This showed up in two ways:
          </p>
          <ul className="cs-list">
            <li>Higher than desired churn for key customer segments.</li>
            <li>Lower than expected export completion and successful project outcomes.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The team needed a clearer product story and a more coherent editor to support both
            self serve users and enterprise accounts.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section className="cs-section">
          <h2>My role</h2>
          <p>
            My role sat at the intersection of product, UX, and strategy. I was responsible for:
          </p>
          <ul className="cs-list">
            <li>Auditing the full product experience and mapping user flows end to end.</li>
            <li>
              Translating customer feedback and internal observations into a structured set of UX
              problems.
            </li>
            <li>
              Designing a new interaction model for AI Studios that could support the 3.0 roadmap.
            </li>
            <li>
              Presenting the findings and recommendations to the CEO and broader team, and aligning
              on what to implement.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section className="cs-section">
          <h2>Approach</h2>
          <h3>1. UX teardown and workflow mapping</h3>
          <p>
            I went through the entire product and recorded detailed walkthroughs of key flows, from
            first entry through project creation and export. I flagged:
          </p>
          <ul className="cs-list">
            <li>Anti intuitive workflows and dead ends.</li>
            <li>Navigation patterns that did not match user expectations.</li>
            <li>Inconsistent branding and visual hierarchy across screens.</li>
            <li>Important features that were visually or structurally buried.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>2. Customer and internal input</h3>
          <p>
            In parallel I spoke with users and internal teams to understand where friction was
            strongest. This helped distinguish between:
          </p>
          <ul className="cs-list">
            <li>Issues that were annoying but tolerable.</li>
            <li>Issues that directly contributed to churn and failed projects.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3. Experience model – Entice, Enter, Engage, Exit, Extend</h3>
          <p>
            To make the work legible across functions, I framed the product around five stages:
          </p>
          <ul className="cs-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Entice</strong> – how we attract and set expectations before users enter.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Enter</strong> – how first time users land, learn, and understand what to do.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Engage</strong> – how people actually create and edit projects.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Exit</strong> – how exporting, sharing, and completion work.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Extend</strong> – how we deepen usage over time through features and loops.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Within each stage I proposed specific changes to layout, interaction patterns, and
            information hierarchy, with a list of 25 concrete recommendations.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section className="cs-section">
          <h2>Recommendations and what changed</h2>
          <p>
            Of the 25 recommendations we documented, roughly 70 percent were implemented fully or in
            part. That included:
          </p>
          <ul className="cs-list">
            <li>Moving to a full screen editor layout to reduce clutter and confusion.</li>
            <li>Improving brand cohesion across the app and tightening visual hierarchy.</li>
            <li>
              Making avatars and templates more visible and easier to browse, instead of being
              hidden in secondary states.
            </li>
            <li>Fixing filter behavior so it matched user expectations.</li>
            <li>Improving onboarding and in product learning moments.</li>
            <li>Adding a more intuitive preview structure for reviewing work in context.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I presented the work directly to the CEO. During the meeting he asked me to record the
            session and share it with the rest of the company. The product roadmap was updated
            quickly, and within a relatively short time the refreshed structure and many of the
            concrete suggestions shipped as part of AI Studios 3.0.
          </p>

        <section className="cs-section">
          <h2>Impact</h2>
          <p>
            Because many improvements shipped together, it is hard to isolate the exact impact of
            any single change. However, taken together we saw:
          </p>
          <ul className="cs-list">
            <li>
              A meaningful reduction in churn for key segments – roughly a one third reduction
              from the prior range, while keeping exact internal numbers confidential.
            </li>
            <li>Higher reliability and consistency in export completion behavior.</li>
            <li>
              A product that was easier for sales and GTM teams to demo for enterprise customers.
            </li>
            <li>
              A clearer baseline for future AI features, since the core editor structure was no
              longer fighting the user.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section className="cs-section">
          <h2>What this shows about my work</h2>
          <p>
            This project highlights how I operate as a hybrid product and UX lead for AI systems.
            It shows that I:
          </p>
          <ul className="cs-list">
            <li>Can audit and reframe a complex, existing product without starting from scratch.</li>
            <li>
              Use both qualitative and quantitative signals to focus on changes that reduce churn
              and improve completion.
            </li>
            <li>
              Communicate clearly enough with leadership that recommendations become part of the
              product direction instead of staying as a slide deck.
            </li>
            <li>
              Treat UX changes as part of go to market and retention strategy, not just visual polish.
            </li>
          </ul>
