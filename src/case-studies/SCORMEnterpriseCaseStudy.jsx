          <h2>Context</h2>
          <p>
            AI Studios was seeing increasing interest from learning and development teams
            who wanted to use AI generated video for training and internal education. Many
            of these teams ran on established LMS platforms and needed SCORM compatible
            content plus predictable workflows for authoring, publishing, and tracking.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without a clear SCORM integration story, AI Studios risked being seen as a
            siloed tool rather than part of the learning stack. We needed to close that
            gap to land and grow enterprise accounts.

        <section className="cs-section">
          <h2>My role</h2>
          <p>
            I operated as a bridge between L&amp;D stakeholders, sales, and engineering.
            My responsibilities included:
          </p>
          <ul className="cs-list">
            <li>
              Understanding how L&amp;D teams currently authored, exported, and tracked
              SCORM content.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mapping where AI Studios would slot into existing workflows instead of
              forcing entirely new patterns.
            </li>
            <li>
              Defining the SCORM related flows, requirements, and edge cases for product
              and engineering.
            </li>
            <li>
              Running early tests and validation with target customers and internal teams.
            </li>
            <li>
              Supporting GTM conversations with a credible, implementation ready story.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section className="cs-section">
          <h2>Approach</h2>

          <h3>1. Enterprise discovery with L&amp;D teams</h3>
          <p>
            I started by working with sales and customer facing teams to understand
            specific enterprise prospects and customers who needed SCORM compatible AI
            video. I focused on:
          </p>
          <ul className="cs-list">
            <li>
              How they currently sourced and produced training content (vendors, in house,
              tools).
            </li>
            <li>
              Their LMS setup and constraints (SCORM versions, reporting expectations,
              security reviews).
            </li>
            <li>
              The difference between a “nice to have demo” and a real deployment.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These conversations shaped the requirements and guardrails for what SCORM
            support needed to look like in AI Studios.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Workflow mapping – where AI Studios fits</h3>
          <p>
            Next, I mapped a typical L&amp;D workflow and overlaid AI Studios on top of
            it. Instead of asking teams to reinvent their process, the goal was:
          </p>
          <ul className="cs-list">
            <li>
              Let L&amp;D experts continue designing learning objectives and structure in
              their existing tools.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use AI Studios as the engine for producing high quality video segments.
            </li>
            <li>
              Make export from AI Studios to LMS as straightforward and predictable as
              possible.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3. Defining SCORM flows and requirements</h3>
          <p>
            Working with engineering, I helped define what SCORM support meant in practice:
          </p>
          <ul className="cs-list">
            <li>Supported SCORM formats and packaging expectations.</li>
            <li>
              How users would configure exports and attach metadata needed by LMS systems.
            </li>
            <li>
              How to handle iterations and updates without breaking existing courses.
            </li>
            <li>
              Error states and validation so users understood when something was wrong
              before it reached the LMS.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I provided concrete flows and UX expectations while leaving implementation
            details to engineering, then iterated based on feasibility and customer input.
          </p>

          <h3>4. Validation and customer alignment</h3>
          <p>
            As prototypes and early versions became available, I participated in tests and
            review cycles, focusing on:
          </p>
          <ul className="cs-list">
            <li>Whether L&amp;D users could complete key tasks without extra coaching.</li>
            <li>
              Whether the exported content behaved correctly inside target LMS platforms.
            </li>
            <li>
              Whether the flow felt like an extension of their existing work, not an
              entirely separate system.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section className="cs-section">
          <h2>Outcome</h2>
          <p>
            The SCORM and enterprise enablement work made AI Studios a more credible
            option for L&amp;D teams evaluating AI video for training. It:
          </p>
          <ul className="cs-list">
            <li>
              Gave sales and GTM a concrete story and workflow to show in enterprise
              demos.
            </li>
            <li>
              Enabled AI Studios to integrate into existing LMS environments rather than
              sitting in a silo.
            </li>
            <li>
              Supported one of the company&apos;s largest learning focused deployments,
              where SCORM compatibility and workflow clarity were critical.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While the impact was shared with engineering, design, and GTM, my contribution
            was to make the workflows and requirements legible enough that the team could
            execute with confidence.

          <h2>What this shows about my work</h2>

          </p>
          <ul className="cs-list">
            <li>
              I can speak both the language of L&amp;D stakeholders and the needs of

            </li>
            <li>
              I treat integrations like SCORM as UX and workflow challenges, not just
              checkboxes.
            </li>
            <li>
              I help turn fuzzy enterprise asks into concrete flows that support sales and
